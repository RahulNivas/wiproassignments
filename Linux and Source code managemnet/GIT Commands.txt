Definition: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This command creates a `.git` directory in the current folder, which contains all the necessary repository files.

	git clone [url]

Definition: Creates a copy of an existing Git repository from a specified URL. This command downloads the repository's files and its entire history.

	git add [file]

Definition: Adds a file to the staging area, making it ready to be committed. The file can be specified by name or by using a wildcard pattern.

	git commit -m "[message]"

Definition: Records the changes in the staging area with a descriptive commit message. This command creates a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes.

	git status

Definition: Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

	git log

Definition: Shows the commit history for the current branch, listing the commits along with their details such as the commit message, author, and date.

	git push [remote] [branch]

Definition: Uploads the local branch commits to the remote repository. This command updates the remote branch with commits made to the local branch.

	git pull [remote] [branch]

Definition: Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository into the current branch. This command combines `git fetch` and `git merge` to update the local repository.

	git branch

Definition: Lists all the branches in the repository. When used with a branch name, it creates a new branch.


	git checkout [branch]

Definition: Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory to match. If the branch doesn't exist, it will switch to a new branch when used with the `-b` option.


	git merge [branch]

Definition: Merges the specified branch into the current branch. This command integrates changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

	git remote

Definition: Manages the set of tracked repositories. This command lets you view and configure remote repositories, such as those hosted on GitHub.

	git fetch [remote]

Definition: Downloads objects and refs from another repository. It fetches updates from the remote repository but does not merge them into the current branch.


	git rebase [branch]

Definition: Reapplies commits on top of another base tip. This command is used to integrate changes from one branch into another by reapplying commits.


	git diff

Definition: Shows the changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc. It compares the changes in the working directory against the staging area.

	git reset [file]

Definition: Removes files from the staging area but keeps the changes in the working directory. When used with `--hard`, it resets the index and working directory to match the specified commit.

	git rm [file]

Definition: Removes a file from the working directory and stages the removal for commit. This command deletes the file from the disk and the repository.

	git stash

Definition: Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed. This command is useful for saving work in progress without committing it.

	git tag [name]

Definition: Creates a tag in the repository, often used to mark release points. Tags are used to create a named reference to a specific commit.

	git config [option] [value]

Definition: Sets configuration options for Git installation, such as username, email, and editor preferences. This command can be used to set both global and repository-specific settings.
